Those project's installation is all the same, so we just make a example.

- you need go to the directory of lightdm-deepin-greeter.pro, firstly;
- create a directory, go to the directory, and run `qmake .. && make`, secondly;
- run `sudo make install`, finally.
- if you want to make your installation work, you may be need to change some configure file
make sure that the lightdm-deepin-greeter is running, or may be it'will run the old one.
In the deepin operation system, you need to copy the file lightdm-deepin-greeter (which you get by run `make`) to the directory "/usr/local/bin".
